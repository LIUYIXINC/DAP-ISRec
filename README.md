This is the source code for the paper "Disentangling Affective Polarities in Sentiment Representations Learning for Implicit Social Recommendation"

First, we processed the datasets and stored them in a directory named 'Data,' which contains the training, validation, and testing files for the Movielens 1M and Bookcrossing datasets. Next, we need to run ML_graph.py and BOOK_graph.py to obtain the processed graph files for both datasets. Finally, ML_run.py serves as the execution file for the Movielens 1M dataset, while BOOK_run.py serves as the execution file for the Bookcrossing dataset. Simply run these two files to seamlessly initiate the model training.
